# DESeq2.py
A personal project tying to remake DESeq2 in python. My goal is to strengthen my coding skills and get a better understanding of DESeq2. I have used chatGPT to create a stratagy to take on this project but not provide any code, I want to get better at coding not have GPT do it for me.

Here is my google doc with my stratagy generated by chatGPT: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZPidC2FrY0MQZ_j4RSRLJUkL69tEUfYTaTZ_Z128CEA/edit?usp=sharing

This project will not be using any libraries beside pandas and numpy, so I can get a better understanding of concepts like dispersion, the negitive bionomial, cooks-cutoff, etc.
